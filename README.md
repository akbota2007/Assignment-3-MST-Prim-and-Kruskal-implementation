Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms - Assignment 3
Implementation and comparison of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree in weighted undirected graphs.
 Project Overview
This project optimizes a city transportation network by determining the minimum set of roads that connect all city districts with the lowest possible total construction cost. The implementation includes:

 Prim's Algorithm with Priority Queue
 Kruskal's Algorithm with Union-Find (Path Compression)
 Performance analysis and comparison
 JSON input/output handling
 Operation counting and time measurement

 Assignment Objectives

Apply graph algorithms to real-world optimization problems
Compare algorithmic efficiency (time and operations)
Analyze performance on different graph structures
Generate comprehensive analytical reports
